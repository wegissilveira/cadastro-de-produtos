# Cadastro de Produtos
<table>
<tr>
<td>
 A complete tool to register and display products. Some may say that this application is just a CRUD, but I'm afraid that it wouldn't be fair. Not even the best poets could describe all the features of this tool with just four letters.   
</tr>
</table>

## Main Features
- Insertion of products with quantity and value;
- Form needs to be validated before submission;
- Quantity can be increased and decreased on the list;
- List displays unit value and total value dynamic based on the quantity;
- List can be sorted based on any of the five columns;
- Items can be searched through a search input;
- If the quantity of an item is decreased until reach 0 it is automatically deleted after a warn;
- All deleted ids are reused, so if we have five ids, 1 to 5, and number 3 is deleted, the next item added will have id 3;
- On desktop version is possible to change the order of the items by dragging and dropping them;
- Editions don't disapear after the page is reloaded or closed;
- Confirmation messages after all actions;
- Responsive;
